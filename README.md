  # Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hiago Teixeira

</span>

I am an Electrical Technician and an undergraduate student in Data Science. Currently, I work as a back-end developer at Mensa Brasil. 

I have experience teaching programming and robotics at UFSJ and Ctrl+Play School in Belo Horizonte. My programming journey began in 2012, when I created a GTA SAMP server using the Pawn language. Since then, I have explored various fields of programming, with a particular emphasis on robotics (C, C++). 

During my undergraduate studies, I became proficient in Python, which has become my primary programming language. I have successfully completed several personal projects using Python, showcasing my skills and passion for solving complex problems through code.
